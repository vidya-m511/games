# Moss Desiccation Tolerance Checker ðŸ§ªðŸŒ¿

This is a fun and educational Python mini-game that compares the **Relative Water Content (RWC)** recovery of two moss species:  
- **Bryum argenteum**  
- **Ceratodon purpureus**

It simulates the rehydration process after desiccation and shows which moss is more desiccation tolerant (DT).

## âœ… Features

- Simple and interactive command-line interface
- Scientific context: RWC recovery after desiccation
- Simulated values based on real-world ecological data
- User-friendly and beginner-friendly

## ðŸ“œ How to Play

1. Run the program in a terminal.
2. Press `Enter` to simulate checking the RWC of each species.
3. The program will simulate drying and recovery.
4. Results will tell you which moss species has higher desiccation tolerance.

## ðŸ§  Concept Behind the Game

- **Bryum argenteum** â€” Known for high desiccation tolerance, especially in extreme and urban environments.
- **Ceratodon purpureus** â€” Tolerant to desiccation but recovers more slowly and to a lesser degree.

The game uses this concept by assigning **simulated recovery percentages** (RWC) and comparing them.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses built-in modules: `time`, `random`)
